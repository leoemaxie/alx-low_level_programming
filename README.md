# Alx Low Level Programming

## Overview
A series of tasks and exercises aimed at understanding the C programming language.

## Structure.
* Hello World: Tasks aimed at having a deep introduction to C, its standard library, compilation and execution. This is housed in the [0x00-hello_world](/0x00-hello_world) directory.

* Variables, If, Else & While: An introduction to C variables, control flow, coditionals and operators. This is housed in the [0x01-variables_if_else_while](/0x01-variables_if_else_while) directory.

* Functions, Nested Loop: A deep dive into C functions, prototypes and C header files. This is housed in the [0x02-functions_nested_loops](/0x02-functions_nested_loops) directory.

* Debugging: An introduction to debugging C programs. This directory contsins mini test to validate some of the earlier tasks. This is housed in the [0x03-debugging](/0x03-debugging) directory.

* More Functions, More Nested Loop: More advanced task aimed at having indepth knowledge of topics treated in earlier directories. This is housed in the [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) directory.	

* Pointers, arrays and strings: An introduction into C pointers. This is housed in the [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) directory.	

* More pointers, arrays and strings: Contains advanced C pointers tasks. This is housed in the [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) directory.
