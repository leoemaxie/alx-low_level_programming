# C - Malloc Free

## Overview
Dynamically allocate memory on the heap. These tasks are aimed at creating memory and freeing up the used space as well as being able to detect and fix memory leaks.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-str_concat.c` are basic tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `100-argstostr.c` are advanced tasks.
