# C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Overview
An introduction into C pointers. This directory contains tasks geared towards pointer arithmetic, string manipulation, arrays and the differences between strings and char arrays.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-strlen.c` are basic tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `100-atoi.c` are advanced tasks.
