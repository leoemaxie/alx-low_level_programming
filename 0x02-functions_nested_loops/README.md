## Overview
A deep dive into C functions, prototypes and headers. Various tasks are contained in this directory aimed at having a deep understanding of C functions.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` are basic tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `100-times_table.c` are advanced tasks.
