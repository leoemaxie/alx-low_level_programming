# C - Even More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Overview
More advanced C pointers. These tasks supplements those contained in `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings` and `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings` directory.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-strchr.c` are basic tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `100-set_string.c` are advanced tasks.
