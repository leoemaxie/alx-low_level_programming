# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Overview
An introduction to the C programming language from ALX. Various tasks are contained in this directory aimed at having a deep understanding of C variables, control flow, conditionals and operators.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-print_alphabet.c` are basic tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-print_comb4.c` are advanced tasks.
